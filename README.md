# BikeParking
There We don't have a specific customer, but we wanted to make life as easy as possible for Moscow cyclists. So we wanted to create a service specifically for cyclists that works easier and faster than competitors. Having analyzed the situation, we realized that in existing services to find information takes a lot of time, as they are designed for a wide range of tasks, while our application performs a narrow task, but simply and quickly. having analyzed the problem we started to implement the project, we found the database, checked it for errors and data cleanliness, sorted it and prepared it for use. After that we wrote the algorithms of the bot, and then the bot itself. Programming was done in Python. The end result was a convenient service oriented to cyclists and working in just 2 clicks. This project has many ways of development, you can create your own standalone application, in which to add the construction of the route, also need to expand the database, so that users across the country could use our service.

In short:

- What you need to do: A service that works faster than widely known applications, focused specifically on cyclists;

- Why: To simplify the life of cyclists and increase their safety;

- For whom: For all cyclists in Moscow;

- Situation analysis: To find information in existing services you need to spend more time and make more clicks;

- Problems: Development of the most rational and convenient approach to implementation.

Translation of the task into technical language:

Data search, data processing, algorithm development and Telegram-bot programming and debugging.
